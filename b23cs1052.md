Matrix Calculator Overview and Execution Guide
Overview:
This C program serves as a matrix calculator capable of performing various operations on matrices. It includes functionalities such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, scalar multiplication, transpose, and calculating the trace of a matrix. Users can interact with the program through the console interface by selecting the desired operation and providing input matrices.

Execution Guide:
Compiling the Program:

Ensure that you have a C compiler installed on your system.
Compile the program using the following command:
Copy code
gcc matrix_calculator.c -o matrix_calculator
This command will generate an executable file named matrix_calculator.
Running the Program:

Execute the compiled program by running the following command:
bash
Copy code
./matrix_calculator
This will start the matrix calculator application.
Using the Matrix Calculator:

Upon running the program, you will be presented with a menu displaying available operations.
Choose the desired operation by entering the corresponding symbol or keyword.
For Addition: Enter +
For Subtraction: Enter -
For Multiplication: Enter *
For Scalar Multiplication: Enter ScalarMultiplication
For Transpose: Enter Transpose
For Trace: Enter Trace
Follow the prompts to input the dimensions and elements of the matrices.
Depending on the selected operation, the program will perform the computation and display the result.
Validations:

The program performs validations on matrix dimensions to ensure compatibility for certain operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication).
Ensure to input valid dimensions (positive integers) for matrices.
If invalid dimensions are provided, the program will display an error message and terminate.
Termination:

Once the operation is completed, the program will terminate.
You can rerun the program to perform additional matrix operations as needed.
